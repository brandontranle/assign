# assign
Uses a ring counter to assign students to projects.

## assign_file.py
Uses testdata.py for *students* and *projects* data, this allows one to have data pre-existing instead of typing into program.

Both *students* and *projects* are expected to be proper Python lists

## assign_csv.py
Uses projects.csv for *students* and *projects* data, this allows one to download the *projects* table and use it for input. This also forces one to have a **GOOD** projects file!
