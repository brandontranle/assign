Change in this one is a best effort to auto-assign, once it is performed,
you have the ability to manually assign.

There are defaults to make it easy to test, hitting return on a query
gets the default.
Students n= 10 (A - J).
Projects n=10 (a - j)
Team projects default to 0, which means the Simple Ring Assignment algorithm,
which is the one I sent in powerpoint.
# of assessments per student is 3

Students are capital letters and projects are lowercase.
The same letter corresponds Student <==> Project as in A <==> a, B <==> b etc.

If teams are entered, enter each group of projects separated by a space,
then a comma to indicate a new team. For example, 3 teams, a b c, f g, h j

I calculate the number of assessments per project and display
so one can see where projects are over/under-subscribed. The default is 3,
which is where most of my testing has been, things will probably break where
we get near the boundary condition of Projects - # of team projects

Finally, I provide the ability to edit the assessments until there is a
reasonable distribution of assessments.

Take a look when you get the chance. I still need to do some significant
refactoring or put into a Jupyter notebookâ€¦
